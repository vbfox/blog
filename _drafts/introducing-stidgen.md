[Stidgen](https://github.com/vbfox/stidgen) is an old (4 years) project of mine
that was created to fill a professional need but that I never really advertised
until now. The name stands for "Strongly Typed ID types GENerator".

What it does is to generate C# types to wrap simple types used as identifiers
(`string` -> `UserId`, `Guid` -> `TweetId`, ...) to have nicely typed code.

A simple `.stidgen` file with the following content :

```csharp
public UserId<string>
public CompanyId<string>
public UploadedFileId<Guid>
```

Generate [a 837 lines file](https://github.com/vbfox/stidgen/blob/1.1.0/samples/Simple.Generated.cs), the types can then be used to get readable type signatures :

```csharp
interface IPopulationQueries
{
    UserInfo GetUserInfo(UserId id);
    CompanyId GetUserCompany(UserId id);
    IReadOnlyCollection<UserId> GetCompanyUsers(CompanyId id);
}
```

## Usage

The latest version of stidgen is available as a dotnet code (2.1+) tool. It can be installed globally like that :

```bash
dotnet tool install --global stidgen
```

and can the be used from anywhere :

```bash
stidgen samples/Simple.stidgen
```

As a dotnet tool it can also be installed in a project and used from CI/FAKE. (No official FAKE module yet, it'll come)

## What ID types provide

A very simple wrapper type can be generated by hand in a dozen of lines but stidgen provide a lot more features by default :

* An immutable structure with a single member, something that the JIT can recognize and optimize away.
* Casts from/to the underlying types.
* Equality members, interfaces and operators.
* Interning of string when it's the underlying type, with nice optimizations to Equal and GetHashCode. I'll try to blog about them it's quite an interesting optimization.
* `ToString()` and formattable overloads are lifted.
* `DebuggerDisplay` is present to simplify debugging.
* Optional protobuf-net attributes generation.

## Comparison with F# solution

While stidgen is written in F# it doesn't provide a way to generate ID types in F#. One of the reason is that generating formatted F# code is quite hard, but the other is that there is already 80% of the features directly available in the language.

The solution to the same problem in F# is to use a single-case discriminated union:

```fsharp
[<Struct>]
type UserId = | UserId of string

[<Struct>]
type CompanyId = | CompanyId of string

[<Struct>]
type UploadedFileId = | UploadedFileId of Guid
```

And F# nicely provide most of what stidgen does by default (Equality interfaces and operators, immutability) but there are still a few missing things so maybe one day i'll work on a F# generator :

* No way to automatically intern strings
* No interning-specific optimizations.
* No check for null (Producing nulls in F# is rare but .NET corelib/libraries can produce them)
* `ToString` isn't handled
* No `DebuggerDisplay`

## The code

Stidgen is an F# project that uses [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn)

## Conclusion

While it's quite an enterprisy
